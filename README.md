# AI: Fear to Fluency

This repo is a personal journal of how I went from being intimidated by artificial intelligence to actively exploring, building, and writing about it. If you’ve ever felt "not technical enough" for AI—you’re not alone.

I'm Nidhi Bhardwaj, a software engineer with 6+ years of backend and mobile experience (Shopify, Expedia, Amazon). This repo documents my journey—starting with fear, and moving toward fluency.

## Why I Created This Repo

- To break down AI into digestible, beginner-friendly steps.
- To stay accountable in learning through *action*, not just reading.
- To show others (especially mid-career devs) that it’s never too late to start.
